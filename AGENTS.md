# AGENTS.md — MinimaAds Agent Guide

Last compacted: 2026-05-18
Scope: `/home/joanramon/Minima/MinimaAds`

This is the short operative guide for agents. Long-form reference material lives in `docs/`.

---

## 0) Mandatory Update Mandate

Any agent making modifications to this repository must update this file before finishing.

Handoff notes must include:
- `AGENTS.md updated: yes/no`
- If `yes`, list affected sections.
- If intentionally not applicable, write `AGENTS.md: N/A` and explain why.

For detailed changes that would make this file noisy, update the relevant document in `docs/` and add only a short pointer here.

---

## 1) Source Of Truth

This project is governed by two documents:

| Document | Role | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| `MinimaAds.md` | Functional and architectural specification | Highest |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operative guide for agents | Derived from `MinimaAds.md` |

If `AGENTS.md` and `MinimaAds.md` conflict, `MinimaAds.md` wins.

Before implementing a feature, read the relevant sections of `MinimaAds.md` and the relevant reference document:

| Topic | Reference |
|---|---|
| Minima/MDS/H2/Rhino platform rules | `docs/PLATFORM_NOTES.md` |
| Project topology, DB mirror, protocols, signals | `docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md` |
| Fragility points and open bugs | `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| Ordered implementation task list | `docs/TASKS.md` |
| New implementation session prompt template | `docs/PromptBase.md` |
| Verification workflow | `docs/VERIFICATION.md` |
| Long change history | `docs/HISTORY.md` |

---

## 2) Required Workflow

1. Read the relevant `MinimaAds.md` sections first.
2. Check `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for known fragility points or open bugs in the touched area.
3. If Minima platform behavior is unclear, consult source and official docs under `refs/`. See `CLAUDE.md §8` for the lookup table.
4. Identify affected layers before editing.
5. Implement in dependency order.
6. Validate contracts, schema parity, Maxima fields, and `poll:false`.
7. Update `AGENTS.md` and, when needed, the relevant `docs/` reference file.

Layer map:

| Layer | Files | MinimaAds.md ref |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `core/*.js` | §7 |
| Service Worker | `service.js`, `public/service-workers/handlers/*.js`, `public/service-workers/db-init.js` | §11 |
| Database schema | `public/service-workers/db-init.js` plus FE initialization | §3.5 |
| SDK | `sdk/index.js` | §13 |
| UI / MiniDapp | `dapp/app.js`, `dapp/views/*.js` | §12.1 |

Implementation order:

1. DB schema, if needed, in both runtimes.
2. Core.
3. Service Worker handlers.
4. SDK.
5. UI.

---

## 3) Stable Contracts

The functions defined in `MinimaAds.md §7` are stable contracts. Do not rename, reorder parameters, or add undocumented parameters without updating `MinimaAds.md` in the same patch.

Stable core signatures:

```javascript
campaigns.js : getCampaigns(cb), getCampaign(id, cb), saveCampaign(campaign, ad, cb),
               updateBudget(campaignId, deductAmount, cb), setCampaignStatus(campaignId, status, cb)
selection.js : selectAd(userAddress, userInterests, campaigns)
validation.js: validateView(campaignId, userAddress, cb), validateClick(campaignId, userAddress, cb),
               isDuplicate(eventId, cb)
rewards.js   : createRewardEvent(params, cb), getUserRewards(userAddress, cb),
               getUserProfile(userAddress, cb)
minima.js    : sqlQuery(query, cb), broadcastMaxima(payload, cb), signalFE(type, data)
```

SDK public API in `sdk/index.js` is an external publisher contract. Treat changes there as breaking unless explicitly approved.

Maxima message schemas in `MinimaAds.md §8` are wire-format contracts. Field changes require a spec update.

---

## 4) Forbidden Actions

Architecture:
- Do not introduce JavaScript frameworks. The frontend is vanilla JavaScript.
- Do not add a build step, bundler, or transpiler.
- Do not add UI logic inside `core/*.js`.
- Do not bypass the Service Worker for inbound network persistence.
- Do not call `MDS.sql` directly outside `core/minima.js`, except existing FE UI code that predates the wrapper; prefer the wrapper for new code.

Maxima:
- Do not send Maxima messages without `poll:false`, except `maxima action:sendall` where Minima has no `poll:false` parameter.
- Do not add new `application:` names. Use `APP_NAME = 'minima-ads'`.
- Do not modify Maxima schemas without updating `MinimaAds.md §8`.

Data model:
- Do not add, rename, or remove fields in Campaign, Ad, RewardEvent, UserProfile, Frame, or Channel models without updating `MinimaAds.md`.
- Do not hardcode LIMITS values inline. Read from the `LIMITS` constant.
- Do not allow a creator to earn rewards from their own campaigns.

Process:
- Do not run `npm run build`, `npm run minima:*`, Capacitor builds, or release packaging unless explicitly requested.
- Do not invent new system flows outside `MinimaAds.md §6`.
- Do not silently change schema/protocol/signal docs without checking `MinimaAds.md`.

---

## 5) Critical Platform Rules

Full details live in `docs/PLATFORM_NOTES.md`. Keep these in active memory:

- Minima MiniDapps run in two independent runtimes: browser FE and Rhino/Nashorn SW.
- Runtime SW entry point is root `service.js`; `dapp.conf` does not control the service file path.
- SW is authoritative for inbound network persistence. FE is authoritative for UI.
- SW logs with `MDS.log()`, not `console.log`.
- SW JavaScript must be Rhino-safe: use `var`, avoid arrow functions, trailing commas, and template literals.
- H2 returns SQL row keys in uppercase.
- H2 has no PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT`; use `MERGE INTO`.
- H2 BOOLEAN values may return as strings.
- H2 omits NULL columns from row objects.
- H2 string comparisons are case-sensitive; use `UPPER()` for IDs and public keys.
- Escape all user input and inbound Maxima payload strings before SQL interpolation.
- Maxima payloads are hex-encoded JSON.
- Public keys must be normalized for `0x`/`0X` casing differences.
- `MDS.comms.solo()` fires `MDSCOMMS` in FE; payload is usually at `event.data.message`.

---

## 6) Project Rules

Full project notes live in `docs/PROJECT_NOTES.md`.

Project identity:
- MinimaAds is a decentralized advertising infrastructure MiniDapp.
- Viewers earn for ad views/clicks.
- Creators fund campaigns through Minima token escrow.
- Publishers operate Frames and earn publisher rewards.

Canonical identities:
- `USER_PROFILE.ADDRESS` and `CAMPAIGN.CREATOR_ADDRESS` are Maxima public keys.
- `FRAMES.FRAME_ID` for the built-in frame is `builtin:<MAXIMA_PK>`.
- `CAMPAIGNS.ESCROW_WALLET_PK` is a wallet signing key, not a Maxima key.

Important files:

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `service.js` | Runtime SW entry point |
| `public/service-workers/db-init.js` | SW schema initialization |
| `dapp/app.js` | FE entry point, routing, MDS event dispatch |
| `dapp/views/*.js` | UI views |
| `core/*.js` | Business logic |
| `sdk/index.js` | External publisher SDK |
| `renderer/renderAd.js` | Ad DOM renderer |

## 7) Validation Checklist

Before final handoff:

- Function signatures still match `MinimaAds.md §7`.
- Maxima message schemas still match `MinimaAds.md §8`.
- Outbound Maxima sends use `poll:false`, or documented `sendall`.
- DB schema changes are applied in both runtimes.
- SQL string inputs are escaped.
- Public key comparisons normalize case.
- `LIMITS` values are not duplicated inline.
- Creator self-reward checks remain in selection and validation paths.
- New or changed SW signals are handled in FE.
- `AGENTS.md` and relevant `docs/` files are updated.

For verification procedures, see `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.

## 8) Current Handoff Notes

2026-05-20 (Publisher REWARD_EVENT now created in SW — PUB-5 fix):
- `public/service-workers/handlers/channel.handler.js` `handleRewardVoucher`: the publisher branch no longer signals `VOUCHER_RECEIVED` to the FE. Instead, the SW creates the `publisher_view` REWARD_EVENT directly via `createRewardEvent`, calls `incrementFrameEarnings`, then signals `PUBLISHER_REWARD_CONFIRMED`. All three functions (`getCampaign`, `getFrame`, `createRewardEvent`, `incrementFrameEarnings`) are already loaded in the SW runtime (`core/campaigns.js`, `core/frames.js`, `core/rewards.js`). The ADS lookup (for `ad_id`) is done inline via a direct `sqlQuery`.
- Root cause of the bug: `MDS.comms.solo()` (used by `signalFE`) is fire-and-forget. If the publisher's FE is not open when the voucher arrives, the `VOUCHER_RECEIVED` signal is permanently lost and the FE's `_onVoucherReceivedCore` never runs — so no `publisher_view` REWARD_EVENT is created. Verified in logs/user2.txt: voucher stored at 09:50:21 (cumulative=40) but earnings only showed 4 rewards (missing 09:50); FE was not open at that moment.
- The viewer voucher branch is unchanged: still signals `VOUCHER_RECEIVED` (without role) so the SDK's `_clearPendingByCumulative` runs when the FE is open. This is correct — viewer pending-marker bookkeeping is FE-only state and needs no SW persistence.
- `sdk/index.js` `_onVoucherReceivedCore` publisher branch is now dead code for the MinimaAds FE (no longer triggered), but is harmless and correct for SDK use in host MiniDapps (MetaChain etc.) where the SDK runs in a separate MiniDapp DB context.
- See `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` Closed/Fixed PUB-5.

2026-05-20 (Per-campaign cooldown + SEL-1 fix):
- `core/selection.js`: removed `_sessionCampaignCount` and the `MAX_CAMPAIGNS_PER_SESSION` early-return guard. The counter was incremented on every ad serve (not confirmed view), exhausting the session budget in under a minute when a host dapp polls MA_GET_AD frequently. DB-level guards (`COOLDOWN_MS`, `MAX_DAILY_VIEWS`) are sufficient. `_seenCampaignIds` rotation retained. See KNOWN_ISSUES.md SEL-1.
- `CAMPAIGNS` table: new column `COOLDOWN_MS BIGINT DEFAULT 300000` — minimum milliseconds between two rewards for the same viewer on a given campaign. Migration via `ALTER TABLE CAMPAIGNS ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS COOLDOWN_MS BIGINT DEFAULT 300000` in `public/service-workers/db-init.js`.
- `core/campaigns.js` (`saveCampaign`, `updateBudget`): `COOLDOWN_MS` included in all MERGE INTO statements; falls back to `LIMITS.COOLDOWN_BETWEEN_REWARDS_MS` when null.
- `core/validation.js` (`validateView`, `validateClick`): cooldown check now reads `campaign.COOLDOWN_MS` with fallback to `LIMITS.COOLDOWN_BETWEEN_REWARDS_MS`. `LIMITS.COOLDOWN_BETWEEN_REWARDS_MS` remains as the global default (currently 30 s) but is no longer the only enforced value.
- `public/service-workers/handlers/campaign.handler.js`: `handleCampaignAnnounce` propagates `payload.cooldown_ms` into `payload.campaign.cooldown_ms` (same pattern as `max_daily_views`). `handleRequestCampaignData` response includes `cooldown_ms` from DB row.
- `dapp/views/creator.js`: new form field `cooldown_s` (seconds, default 300) in the Viewer tab. Converted to ms on submit and stored as `campaign.cooldown_ms`. Included in `CAMPAIGN_ANNOUNCE` payload as `cooldown_ms`.
- `MinimaAds.md §3.5` and `§8.3` updated: `COOLDOWN_MS` column added to CAMPAIGNS schema; `cooldown_ms` added to CAMPAIGN_ANNOUNCE wire format with backward-compat note.

2026-05-19 (Budget left accuracy):
- `public/service-workers/handlers/channel.handler.js` `swBuildAndPostChannelTx`: the split Tx1 now updates `BUDGET_REMAINING = change` alongside `ESCROW_COINID` when the split TX posts. Previously only `ESCROW_COINID` was updated — `BUDGET_REMAINING` only decremented by `reward_view` (1 token) per view event, leaving it far above the actual on-chain escrow amount. Now `BUDGET_REMAINING` reflects the real remaining escrow amount immediately on channel open, for both viewer and publisher splits.
- `public/service-workers/handlers/campaign.handler.js` `processEscrowCoin`: now compares `coin.amount` against `CAMPAIGN.BUDGET_REMAINING` in addition to the `coinId` check. If they differ (stale DB from old code or after SW restart), syncs `BUDGET_REMAINING` and `ESCROW_COINID` from the on-chain coin. Acts as a reconciliation pass on every SW session start (once per coinId per in-memory session). Known minor fragility: between Tx1 (split) and Tx2 (channel open), both the split coin (small) and the change coin (large) are simultaneously visible at `ESCROW_ADDRESS`. If a NEWBLOCK fires in this window, `processEscrowCoin` may process the split coin first (setting `BUDGET_REMAINING` to the split amount), then immediately correct it from the change coin. Both processed in the same scan pass — final value is always correct. Not visible in UI in practice. See `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` fragility entry.

2026-05-19:
- `public/service-workers/handlers/channel.handler.js`: after a viewer `openChannel()` deducts `CAMPAIGNS.BUDGET_REMAINING`, the SW now emits `CAMPAIGN_UPDATED` with the refreshed budget/status. This makes the Stats `Budget left` table refresh while the Stats route is open instead of waiting for another campaign signal or manual reload.
- `dapp/app.js` `PUBLISHER_REWARD_CONFIRMED` handler: changed to call `loadEarnings()` (full reload). Previously only refreshed the history table — "Total earned" headline stayed stale when new publisher vouchers arrived.
- `dapp/views/earnings.js` `onSettleConfirmed()`: added `getUserProfile` reload + re-render of the summary section after settlement. Previously only the channel list and reward history updated.
- `core/rewards.js` `createRewardEvent()`: replaced non-atomic read-modify-write `MERGE INTO` for `USER_PROFILE.TOTAL_EARNED` with atomic `UPDATE ... SET TOTAL_EARNED = COALESCE(TOTAL_EARNED, 0) + amount`. Prevents lost increments under concurrent reward events. INSERT path for new users unchanged.
- Verified end-to-end with earnings.txt (19/5/2026): user2 (publisher) 20 MINIMA and user3 (viewer) 2 MINIMA consistent across Total earned / Settled channels / Reward history. Zero errors in all log files.
